/**
 * Extracts the UTC calendar day of a date as a `YYYY-MM-DD` string.
 *
 * Safe for both `Date` objects and date-ish strings (legacy `YYYY-MM-DD`
 * DATEONLY values and Postgres timestamptz text like `2026-06-20 12:00:00+00`).
 * Used so day-bucketing and day-level comparisons stay anchored to the UTC
 * calendar day regardless of the server's timezone — otherwise the same instant
 * could bucket into different days across deploys with different host TZs.
 *
 * String inputs are sliced (the first 10 chars are the `YYYY-MM-DD` prefix of
 * both shapes); `Date` inputs are read via the `getUTC*` accessors and
 * zero-padded.
