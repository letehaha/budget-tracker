/**
 * The Holding model represents individual investments within an investment account.
 * It tracks the specific securities that an account holds, along with the quantity of each security.
 * The current market value of each holding is dynamically calculated using the quantity and
 * the current market prices from the SecurityPricing model. This model is crucial for maintaining
 * a detailed record of a user's investment portfolio. It enables tracking the performance and value
 * of individual investments over time through periodic updates of market prices and real-time
 * portfolio valuation. This facilitates comprehensive portfolio analysis and reporting, providing insights
 * into investment growth and asset allocation.
 *
 * Dynamic Value Calculation:
 * The market value of a security changes over time as its price fluctuates.
 * By referencing the SecurityPricing table, which stores historical and current
 * prices of securities, the application can dynamically calculate the current
 * value of each holding.
 *
 * Historical Performance:
 * To assess the performance of a holding over time, the application can compare
 * historical prices from the SecurityPricing table with the purchase price
 * (potentially stored in the Holding model as cost basis) and the current price.
 *
 * To be super simple, the association looks like that:
 * 1. Account has Holdings.
 * 2. Holding contains Security name, it's value based on prices, and quantity.
 * 3. InvestmentTransaction CRUDs Security inside Holding.
 *
 * **Notes:**
 * 1. No need to store averageCost because we can easily calculate it from by
 * using "costBasis / quantity" formula. That way we simply data storage and
 * always have up to date value

   * The `quantity` field represents the total number of units or shares

   * The `costBasis` field represents the original value or purchase price of an
   * investment in the Holding model.
   * It includes the price paid per unit of the security plus any associated
   * expenses like commissions or fees.
   * This field is vital for calculating capital gains or losses when the
   * investment is sold and for assessing the overall performance of the
   * investment. It also plays a crucial role in determining tax liabilities
   * related to capital gains. The cost basis can be adjusted for corporate
   * actions and other financial events.
   *
   * Example:
   * If an investor bought 100 shares of a company at $10 per share, and they paid
   * a $50 commission, their costBasis for this investment would be:
   * $1,050 (100 shares * $10 + $50 commission).
   *
   * Important:
   * It needs to be recalculated when there are new investment transactions that
   * affect the quantity or value of holding.
