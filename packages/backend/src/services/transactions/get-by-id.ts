 * Fetch a transaction visible to the caller, paired with the resolved access result.
 *
 * Returns `{ tx, access }` when the caller has at least `requiredPermission` on the
 * transaction's parent account; returns `null` otherwise (so callers can throw a clean
 * 404 with no existence leak). Callers branch on `access.isOwner` and `access.policy`
 * for owner-vs-recipient logic and the `transactionsWriteScope: 'own'` rule, so they
 * don't need to call `canUserAccessResource` themselves.
 *
 * Visibility resolution:
 *   1. Caller authored the row AND owns the parent account → fast path, synthesize
 *      `isOwner: true` with `manage`. Saves a share-table lookup in the common case.
 *   2. Caller authored the row on a *shared* account (parent account belongs to someone
 *      else) → fall through to the share-aware resolver so `ownerUserId` resolves to
 *      the actual account owner. Without this, downstream code that scopes by
 *      `accountOwnerUserId` (category lookup, account currency lookup) would search
 *      under the recipient's userId and miss the owner's rows.
 *   3. Caller did NOT author the row but has an accepted share → granted at the share's
 *      permission level (subject to `requiredPermission`).
 *   4. Anything else → `null` (404 territory).

 *

 *   - `NotFoundError` (404) when the row truly doesn't exist.
 *   - `ForbiddenError` (403) when the row exists but the caller has no claim. Tx ids are
 *     UUIDv7 so existence-leak via 403 vs 404 is not a meaningful side channel; surfacing

 *     when a budget-share recipient tries to edit an owner-only tx (e.g. visible inside

 *     author the row.
 *
 * Phase-1 cross-boundary guards (transfer / refund / changes-account) stay separate via
 * `assertSharedWritePhase1Guards` — those depend on the *operation* (payload), not the
 * fetched row, so they live at the call site.
