/**
 * European waterfall carry computation for a single distribution/exit
 * event. LP-principal-first: GP only earns carry on profit remaining
 * after the LP's full principal has been returned across all prior
 * distributions.
 *
 * Hurdle math is a linear approximation (`principalRemaining * hurdlePct *
 * yearsHeld`). For SK 116 (hurdle=0) this is exact. Real IRR-based
 * waterfalls w/ GP catchup are deferred to v2 — the `waterfallType` param
 * is reserved for that addition.
 *
 * Inputs and outputs are decimal strings (Money-compatible). Computation
 * uses big.js to avoid float drift.
 *
 * @returns `gpCarry` + `lpNet` as DECIMAL(20,10) strings, plus the
 *          `principalReturnedThisEvent` portion so the caller can update
 *          `cumulativeLpPrincipalReturned` for the next event in the chain.
