 * schedules resolution to run once the transaction commits. Enqueuing after
 * commit is required: the worker reads the subscription on a separate
 * connection, so enqueuing inside the open transaction races the commit and the
 * worker can still see the stale `logoSource = 'manual'` value, which its guard
 * skips on – leaving the reset subscription with no logo and no re-resolution.
