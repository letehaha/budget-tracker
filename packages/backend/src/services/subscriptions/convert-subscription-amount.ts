/**
 * Converts the subscription's billed amount (`expectedAmount` cents, in
 * `expectedCurrencyCode`) into the currency of the account it is paid from,
 * valued at `date`.
 *
 * A subscription can be billed in one currency (e.g. a USD plan) while paid
 * from an account in another (e.g. a UAH card). The booked expense must be in
 * the account's currency, so the billed amount is converted at payment time.
 * The pay-preview and the actual booking call this same function — what the
 * user confirms is exactly what gets booked, never different.
 *
 * Returns the unchanged `expectedAmount` (as Money) when the subscription
 * shares the account's currency, and `null` when there is no `expectedAmount`
 * to convert (a variable-amount subscription such as a bill type).
