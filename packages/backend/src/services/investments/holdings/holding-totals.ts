/**
 * Replays a holding's transactions into its current quantity and cost basis.
 *
 * Cost basis tracks the cost of the *current long position* only:
 * - While the running quantity is ≤ 0 there is no long position, so the basis
 *   is zero.
 * - A BUY that crosses from short/zero into long counts only the portion above
 *   zero; the rest merely covered the short.
 * - A BUY on top of an existing long position adds its full cost.
 * - A SELL reduces the basis proportionally to the shares remaining, and a SELL
 *   that drains the position to zero resets the basis. This is what makes a
 *   same-day wash sale (sell the whole position, then rebuy) keep only the
 *   rebuy lot.
 *
 * The replay is order-sensitive: `transactions` MUST be supplied in
 * chronological (date, then insertion) order. A rebuy seen before the sell that
 * liquidated the previous lots would blend their cost into the basis instead of
 * resetting it.
 *
 * NOTES:
 * - The `quantity ≤ 0 ⇒ basis 0` guard is load-bearing, not defensive: without
 *   it, a SELL taken while the running quantity is negative computes a negative
 *   `remaining / total` proportion and *adds* to the basis instead of reducing
 *   it, which can balloon the cost basis (e.g. crypto positions that drift
 *   negative on fee/staking rows).
 * - DIVIDEND and FEE legs intentionally affect neither quantity nor basis here;
 *   they are accounted for elsewhere.
