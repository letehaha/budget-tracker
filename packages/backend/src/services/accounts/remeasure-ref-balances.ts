 * historical rates (an account drained to zero would keep a nonzero ref residue).
 *
 * Runs after every rate sync (all accounts) and after a user edits/removes a
 * custom rate (their accounts only). Each account is re-measured independently;
 * a per-account failure is counted and logged so the rest still proceed.
 *
 * The per-account catch is asymmetric: on the custom-rate path a `DatabaseError`
 * has aborted the ambient transaction, so it's re-thrown to roll the request back
 * rather than let the endpoint's COMMIT-turned-ROLLBACK drop the rate write
 * silently. On the cron each account owns an already-rolled-back transaction, so
 * it counts-and-continues. The designed missing-rate error is not a
 * `DatabaseError`, so it always counts-and-continues.
