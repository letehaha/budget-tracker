/**
 * Shift an account's balance by a signed delta while absorbing the same delta
 * into its opening balance, so `currentBalance = initialBalance + Σ(tx)` keeps
 * holding without spawning an adjustment transaction.
 *
 * Only the NATIVE delta is supplied; the ref side is derived, not delta-shifted:
 * `refCurrentBalance` is a spot measure of the shifted native balance at the latest
 * rate, and `refInitialBalance` is restamped at the ledger-boundary rate (which
 * cascades the change into the Balances history). Summing a caller-supplied
 * `refAmountDelta` from historical per-row `refAmount`s instead would keep the
 * opening ref balance a blend of historical rates.
 *
 * Deltas compose: the account row is read under SELECT ... FOR UPDATE, so
 * concurrent absorbs (two imports finalizing into one account, or an import racing
 * a bank sync) serialize and each applies its delta on top of the other's result.
 * An absolute target from a pre-work snapshot would discard a concurrent writer's
 * change.
 *
 * Non-system accounts keep their provider-owned `initialBalance` /
 * `refInitialBalance` untouched; only the current balances move. The returned row
 * is re-read after all derived writes, so its ref fields are current.
