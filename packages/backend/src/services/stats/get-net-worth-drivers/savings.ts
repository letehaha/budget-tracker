 * and `net` is `income - expenses`.
 *
 * Transfers never reach here — the caller filters them out at the query level,
 * which is what makes savings "money that actually entered or left the user's
 * finances" rather than money shuffled between their own accounts.
 *
 * Refunded money was neither spent nor earned, so each pair is subtracted from both
 * sides in the bucket the money came back in — the same netting `get-cash-flow` does,
 * which leaves `net` untouched.
