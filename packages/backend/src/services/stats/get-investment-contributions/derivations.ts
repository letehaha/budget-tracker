/**
 * Fold each portfolio transfer into its bucket as a signed net-cents delta: one
 * `portfolioId -> cents` map per bucket, positionally aligned with `buckets`.
 *
 * A transfer counts only when it crosses a portfolio's outer boundary:
 *  - inbound (+) when a scoped portfolio is the destination and there is no source
 *    portfolio (account -> portfolio funding, direct deposit);
 *  - outbound (-) when a scoped portfolio is the source and there is no destination
 *    portfolio (portfolio -> account withdrawal, direct withdrawal).
 * A transfer naming a portfolio on both sides never leaves the boundary — a
 * portfolio<->portfolio move or a same-portfolio currency exchange — so it is
 * skipped and reads as neither contribution nor withdrawal.
 *
 * `activePortfolioIds` is derived after the fold: a portfolio is active only when
 * its net is non-zero in at least one bucket, so a portfolio whose deposits and
 * withdrawals cancel to zero everywhere is left out of the legend entirely.
 *
 * `new Date(transfer.date)` on a DATEONLY string parses to that day's UTC
 * midnight, the same basis `generatePeriodBuckets` builds its edges on, so a
 * transfer lands in the bucket the requested range clamps its day to.
