/**
 * Recomputes `Transactions.refundLinked` for the given ids from the links that actually exist.
 *
 * One purchase can carry several partial refunds, so dropping a single link says nothing about
 * whether the flag should go down. Every read path that nets refunds out of expenses starts from
 * this flag — `resolveRefundPairs`, `fetchBudgetRefundPairs` and the pivot equivalent only look up
 * links for transactions that carry it — so a flag cleared while a link survives makes that refund
 * stop netting and the expense report overstate.
 *
 * The new value is computed inside the UPDATE so Postgres re-evaluates it after taking the row
 * lock. Reading the links first and writing the result back would let a concurrent request insert
 * a link in the gap and have this one overwrite the flag it just set.
 *
 * No `userId` filter: callers pass ids they have already authorized, and the flag has exactly one
 * correct value per row regardless of who wrote it.
