/**
 * Replay a loan's post-anchor payment legs into a per-day outstanding-balance
 * series: the anchor snapshot followed by one cumulative end-of-day point per
 * calendar day that has legs. Both the native-currency history endpoint and the
 * base-currency Balances rebuild run the same walk — `pickCents` selects which
 * amount (nominal vs. ref) each leg contributes, and `openingBalance` is the
 * matching anchor snapshot; everything else about the walk is identical, so the
 * two currencies can never disagree on day grouping, ordering, or the zero floor.
 *
 * Legs are grouped by UTC calendar day (`utcDayKey`) because that is exactly how
 * the SQL `DATE("time") >= anchorDate` filter classifies them in a UTC database;
 * a server-local day would disagree near midnight on non-UTC servers. A leg that
 * classifies before the anchor is folded onto the anchor day — an invariant
 * guard so no point ever lands ahead of the series start.
 *
 * Balances are stored negative (liability); income legs add toward zero. A batch
 * that overshoots the owed amount would push the balance positive (credit), but a
 * loan never carries credit, so each running balance is floored at zero.
