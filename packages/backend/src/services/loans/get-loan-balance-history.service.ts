/**
 * Outstanding-balance series of a loan in its native currency: the anchor

 * convention) followed by one cumulative end-of-day point per day that has
 * payment legs. Mirrors the Balances-history rebuild in
 * `recompute-loan-balance.service` — same anchor-day grouping, same
 * floor-at-zero — but sums nominal `amount` instead of `refAmount`: the
 * Balances table stores base-currency figures, which cannot be plotted on a
 * loan-currency axis for foreign-currency loans.
 *
 * Throws NotFoundError when the loan doesn't exist, belongs to another user,
 * or the account isn't a loan (non-loan accounts have no LoanDetails sidecar).
