Since the current subtask is 1.1 and they've completed it, I need to generate content that documents their completion for the current subtask's details.\n\nCOMPLETED: Successfully created comprehensive database migration file for Portfolio architecture at packages/backend/src/migrations/20250130000000-create-portfolio-tables.ts. Implemented all three required tables (Portfolios, PortfolioBalances, PortfolioTransfers) with proper foreign key relationships, optimized indexes, and comprehensive constraints including portfolio type enum validation, composite primary keys, and complex transfer direction validation. Migration follows project TypeScript patterns with transaction safety and proper rollback procedures. All monetary values use DECIMAL(20,10) precision with multi-currency support through separate reference fields for base currency conversion.\n</info added on 2025-06-23T20:34:41.045Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-23T21:05:22.364Z>\nARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENT: Updated currency handling to use foreign keys instead of currency codes. Changed PortfolioBalances.currencyCode and PortfolioTransfers.currencyCode to currencyId fields with foreign key constraints to Currencies table. Updated composite primary key for PortfolioBalances to use (portfolioId, currencyId) and modified indexes accordingly. This change provides data integrity through FK constraints, improves query efficiency with direct joins, enables direct access to exchange rates, and aligns with existing codebase patterns where Accounts and Transactions already use currencyId. Storage efficiency improved using INTEGER (4 bytes) vs VARCHAR(3). Migration maintains transaction safety and includes proper rollback procedures.\n</info added on 2025-06-23T21:05:22.364Z>",
