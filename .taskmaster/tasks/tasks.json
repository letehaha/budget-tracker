        "details": "1. Create Vue composables for portfolio operations:\n   - usePortfolioCreate(): Handle portfolio creation\n   - usePortfolioRead(): Fetch portfolio details\n   - usePortfolioUpdate(): Update portfolio information\n   - usePortfolioDelete(): Delete a portfolio\n   - usePortfolioBalance(): Fetch and manage portfolio balance\n   - usePortfolioTransfer(): Handle portfolio transfers\n   - usePortfolioList(): Manage portfolio listing with filtering and sorting\n\n2. Implement API integration:\n   - Use Axios or Fetch API to make HTTP requests to backend endpoints\n   - Ensure proper error handling for all API calls\n   - Implement retry logic for failed requests\n\n3. Create type definitions for API responses:\n   - Define interfaces for Portfolio, Balance, Transfer, and other related entities\n   - Use these types throughout the composables for better type safety\n\n4. Implement error handling and loading states:\n   - Create a custom error handling utility to standardize error messages\n   - Use Vue refs to manage loading states for each operation\n   - Implement a global error handling mechanism for unexpected errors\n\n5. Develop a caching strategy:\n   - Use Pinia or Vuex for state management\n   - Implement a caching layer to store frequently accessed data\n   - Set up cache invalidation rules based on user actions and time\n\n6. Create utility functions:\n   - Implement sorting and filtering functions for portfolio listing\n   - Create currency formatting helpers for consistent display\n\n7. Optimize performance:\n   - Use debounce for search and filter operations\n   - Implement pagination for large datasets\n\n8. Ensure multi-currency support:\n   - Handle currency conversions in balance calculations\n   - Display multi-currency information in portfolio listings and details\n\n9. Implement real-time updates:\n   - Set up WebSocket connections for real-time balance updates\n   - Use Vue watchers to react to real-time data changes",
        "testStrategy": "1. Unit Tests:\n   - Test each composable function in isolation\n   - Mock API calls and test different response scenarios (success, error, loading)\n   - Verify error handling logic works as expected\n   - Test utility functions for sorting, filtering, and currency formatting\n\n2. Integration Tests:\n   - Test the interaction between composables and the API layer\n   - Verify that caching strategy works correctly\n   - Test real-time update functionality with mocked WebSocket events\n\n3. E2E Tests:\n   - Create end-to-end tests for complete portfolio management workflows\n   - Test portfolio creation, reading, updating, and deletion\n   - Verify portfolio listing with different filter and sort options\n   - Test portfolio transfer functionality\n\n4. Performance Tests:\n   - Measure and optimize loading times for portfolio listing\n   - Test caching effectiveness with large datasets\n\n5. Error Handling Tests:\n   - Simulate various error conditions (network errors, API errors)\n   - Verify that error messages are displayed correctly to the user\n\n6. Multi-currency Tests:\n   - Test balance calculations and display with multiple currencies\n   - Verify currency conversion logic in transfers and balance updates\n\n7. Accessibility Tests:\n   - Ensure all new components and interactions are accessible\n   - Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation\n\n8. Cross-browser Testing:\n   - Verify functionality across different browsers and devices\n\n9. Security Testing:\n   - Ensure sensitive data is not exposed in client-side code\n   - Test for proper handling of authentication tokens",
