# Code Modification Practices

## Rules
1. NEVER modify existing code unless absolutely necessary for the current feature/task
2. Examples of changes to avoid unless specifically required:
   - Modifying existing route paths
   - Changing function implementations
   - Refactoring working code
   - Updating parameter names/types
   - Changing response formats
3. If you believe a change would be beneficial:
   - Do not implement it as part of the current task
   - Ask explicitly if the change should be implemented
   - Explain why the change would be beneficial
   - Wait for approval before making any modifications
4. When a change is necessary:
   - Document why the change is required
   - Keep the change minimal and focused
   - Ensure backward compatibility where possible
