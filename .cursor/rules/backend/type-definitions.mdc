# Type Definitions

## Common Types Location
- API types: @bt/shared/types/api.ts
- DB models: @bt/shared/types/db-models.ts
- Endpoints: @bt/shared/types/endpoints.ts

## Type Usage Rules
1. Always define interfaces for service parameters
2. Use shared types from @bt/shared/types
3. Export types when they're used across modules
4. Use proper typing for async operations
5. Define enum types in shared location
