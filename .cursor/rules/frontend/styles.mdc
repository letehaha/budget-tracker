# Architecture Overview

1. When working with styles in the frontend package, we're using Tailwind.
2. Colors are defined in packages/frontend/src/styles/global.css
3. Component-specific styles should be defined using Tailwind utility classes directly in the component files.
4. Avoid using custom CSS unless absolutely necessary; prefer Tailwind utilities for consistency and maintainability
5. Never apply default tailwind colors directly; always use the defined color variables from global.css
6. If there's no colors that fit your needs, please add them to global.css instead of using raw color values.
